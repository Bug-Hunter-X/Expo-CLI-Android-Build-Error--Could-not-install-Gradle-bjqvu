# Expo CLI Android Build Error: Could not install Gradle

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Android apps with the Expo CLI. The error message typically indicates that Gradle, the build system for Android, cannot be installed or accessed correctly. This is often due to missing or incorrectly configured Android SDK components.

## Problem

The primary issue is the inability to install Gradle, leading to a failed app installation. This can manifest as:

* `error Failed to install the app. Cause: Could not install Gradle. Cause: Gradle distribution url is incorrect.`
* Other errors related to Gradle not being found or accessible.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the Android SDK and NDK are properly installed and configured. This includes verifying the correct paths and permissions.

1. **Verify Android SDK and NDK Installation:** Make sure you have the necessary Android SDK and NDK installed and added to your environment variables (PATH).  You can download them from the official Android developer website.  Specific versions might be required by your Expo project. Check your `android/gradle.properties` file for the necessary versions.
2. **Check PATH environment variables:** Ensure that the `ANDROID_HOME` and `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` environment variables are correctly set and point to your Android SDK installation directory.  Similar for NDK paths.
3. **Permissions:** Verify that your user has the necessary permissions to access and modify the Android SDK and NDK directories.
4. **Gradle Wrapper:** Ensure the Gradle wrapper is functioning correctly.  Try running `./gradlew clean` in the android folder of your project to see if that helps resolve the issue.
5. **Proxy Settings:** If you're behind a proxy, ensure your Gradle settings account for this.  The `gradle.properties` file might require proxy configuration details.
6. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Try cleaning your project and rebuilding it using `expo prebuild` and then `expo run:android`. This often resolves transient issues.
7. **Project Specific Issues:** If the problem persists, carefully check your project's `android/gradle.properties` file for any typos or inconsistencies in the NDK version or paths. You might need to upgrade your Gradle version or change specific settings in this file.
