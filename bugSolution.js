This solution focuses on ensuring the Android SDK and NDK are correctly installed and configured.  It's vital to check your environment variables and project-specific Gradle settings.

// No code changes are needed in the JS code; the error is purely on the Android build side.
```

Here's a summary of the command-line steps to check and adjust your settings:

1. **Check Android SDK and NDK installation:**

   ```bash
   echo $ANDROID_HOME
   echo $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT
   ```

2. **Check Gradle Wrapper:**

   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew clean
   ```

3. **Clean and rebuild the project:**

   ```bash
   expo prebuild
   expo run:android
   ```

4. **Inspect gradle.properties (in the android folder):**

Check for typos, incorrect paths, and version numbers in the `android/gradle.properties` file, especially those related to the NDK. Correct any inconsistencies. 

By carefully following these steps, and making necessary adjustments to your Android SDK/NDK configuration, the Gradle installation error should be resolved.
