This error typically occurs when the Expo CLI cannot find or access the necessary Android SDK or NDK components.  This might happen if the Android SDK or NDK are not installed, the paths are incorrect, or there are permission issues. Another possibility is that your project is trying to use Android features not supported in your version of Expo.  Check `android/gradle.properties` for the correct NDK version.
